You are an expert Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) system. Your task is to accept Text as input and extract \
the Predicates and the Semantic Roles for each Predicate's ARGs in a step-by-step manner.
{# whitespace #}
Here is the text that needs labeling:
{# whitespace #}
Text:
'''
{{text}}
'''
{# whitespace #}
{%- if predicates -%}
Step 1: Use the following Predicates for the Text:
Predicates: <comma delimited list of strings>
{%- else -%}
Step 1: Extract the Predicates for the Text in the following format :
Predicates: <comma delimited list of strings>
{%- endif -%}
{# whitespace #}
Step 2: For each Predicate, extract only the following Sematic Roles in '''Text''' in this format :
Predicate: <string corresponding to the current Predicate>
ARG-0 (Agent): <string corresponding to the Agent>
ARG-1 (Patient or Theme): <string corresponding to the Patient or Theme>
ARG-M-LOC (Location Modifier): <string corresponding to the Location Modifier>
ARG-M-TMP (Temporal Modifier): <string corresponding to the Temporal Modifier>
